# 🔧 Docker Backend Connectivity Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

The frontend was unable to connect to the backend API, showing 404 errors for login requests:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Incorrect API URL Configuration**: The frontend environment variable was set to `http://localhost:3001` but should have been `http://localhost:3001/api`
2. **Health Check Misconfiguration**: The backend health check was trying to access an authenticated endpoint
3. **Missing `/api` Path**: The frontend was trying to reach endpoints without the proper API base path

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Frontend API URL**
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
# Before
environment:
  - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# After  
environment:
  - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### 2. **Fixed Backend Health Check**
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
# Before
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3001/api/system/state"]

# After
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3001/api/healthz"]
```

### 3. **Removed Obsolete Docker Compose Version**
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
# Removed
version: '3.8'
```

## 🧪 **Verification Results**

All tests now pass successfully:

✅ **Both containers are running**
✅ **Frontend API URL correctly configured**: `http://localhost:3001/api`
✅ **Backend health endpoint responding**
✅ **Backend login endpoint working**
✅ **Frontend is accessible on port 3000**
✅ **Command processing working**
✅ **CORS headers present**

## 🚀 **Current Status**

The Docker deployment is now fully functional:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001/api ✅
- **Authentication**: Working with PIN 0000 ✅
- **Commands**: All natural language commands working ✅
- **Real-time Updates**: System state updates correctly ✅

## 📋 **How to Use**

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the frontend**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Login with PIN**: 0000

4. **Test commands**:
   - "status" - Check system status
   - "sesame close" - Arm the system
   - "sesame open" - Disarm the system
   - "lock" / "unlock" - Arm/disarm system

## 🔧 **Verification Script**

Run the verification script to confirm everything is working:
```bash
./scripts/verify-docker-fix.sh
```

## 🎯 **Resolution Summary**

The issue was a simple configuration problem where the frontend was missing the `/api` path in its base URL. This caused all API requests to fail with 404 errors. The fix ensures that:

1. Frontend correctly connects to `http://localhost:3001/api`
2. Backend health checks use the public health endpoint
3. All API endpoints are accessible from the browser
4. CORS is properly configured for cross-origin requests

The application now works seamlessly in Docker with full end-to-end functionality.
